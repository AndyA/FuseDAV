   [11]Version 0.1 released, initial release

Overview

   fusedav is a Linux userspace file system driver for mounting [12]WebDAV
   shares. It makes use of [13]FUSE as userspace file system API and
   [14]neon as WebDAV API.

Current Status

   Version 0.2 works fine.

Documentation

   After installation just run fusedav with two arguments: the WevDAV URL
   and the local mount point:
fusedav http://webdav.foo.bar/ /tmp/test

   You will be queried for a username and password if required. As long as
   the fusedav process is running, the file system is accessible under
   /tmp/test.

Requirements

   fusedav was developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux "testing" from
   April 2006, it should work on most other Linux distributions since it
   uses GNU autoconf for source code configuration.

   fusedav requires the [15]neon (0.26 minimum - 0.25 does not suffice!)
   built with thread-safe SSL and LFS support, and [16]FUSE (2.5 minimum)
   development library files for compilation.

Installation

   As this package is made with the GNU autotools you should run
   ./configure inside the distribution directory for configuring the
   source tree. After that you should run make for compilation and make
   install (as root) for installation of fusedav.

Acknowledgements

   Milos Szeredi for developing FUSE and some useful hints for its usage

   Sebastien Estienne for some packaging work

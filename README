Overview
========

fusedav is a Linux userspace file system driver for mounting WebDAV
shares. It makes use of FUSE as userspace file system API and neon as
WebDAV API.

Current Status
==============

Version 0.2 works fine.

Documentation
=============

After installation just run fusedav with two arguments: the WevDAV URL
and the local mount point:

  fusedav http://webdav.foo.bar/ /tmp/test

You will be queried for a username and password if required. As long as
the fusedav process is running, the file system is accessible under
/tmp/test.

Requirements
============

fusedav was developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux "testing" from
April 2006, it should work on most other Linux distributions since it
uses GNU autoconf for source code configuration.

fusedav requires the neon (0.26 minimum - 0.25 does not suffice!) and
FUSE (2.5 minimum) development library files for compilation.

Installation
============

As this package is made with the GNU autotools you should run
./configure inside the distribution directory for configuring the source
tree. After that you should run make for compilation and make install
(as root) for installation of fusedav.
